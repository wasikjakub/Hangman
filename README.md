# Hangman
This is a small project that i made on holidays 2022 to refresh my python skills before semester, it's 100% my idea of Hangman and i wasn't recreating anybody's idea from the web
## How does it work?
This is what pop's up after running the code  
![1](https://github.com/wasikjakub/Hangman/assets/144064944/28fe20a3-9821-4fac-a340-78b80aaf4be1)  
  
Then you can take a wrong guess

Or a good guess

Even if you guess the same letter twice the program got you

So if you keep guessing right You will be notified how many tries did it take You

Don't worry, if You got bad luck and didn't manage to guess the word the program will fill Your curiosity
